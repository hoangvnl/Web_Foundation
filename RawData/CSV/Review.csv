1,16,5,"This course was chill. I would absolutely have dropped it after the first week if my crush wasn't also taking it. The lectures were certainly reminiscent of my 3rd grade social sciences class. The textbook made me want to speak with the dean. Actually, from the one reading I did, I got the impression that the readings were only interesting because of the pictures of my homophobic uncle. If I were to restructure the course, I would make sure the deadlines were not 50% of the grade for the class, I found that to be boring."
1,9,5,"This course was fascinating. I would completely make it way easier. The syllabus was definitely not legendary. The textbook made me want to become a better person. Now that it's over, I can safely say I'm pretty sure the final was inspired by lemurs. In the future, I would make sure the essay prompts were not part of the course, totally out of context and at times offensive."
2,23,4,"This course was stupid. I would definitely recommend it to others. The 'required' readings were basically never out of context and at times offensive. The professor's inscrutable handwritting made me want to change majors. Like, actually, I looked online and the handouts were basically just tweets written by feminists. If this course were taught again, I would make sure the TA sessions were way more contrary to the theory of intelligent design."
2,7,4,"This course was so post-modern. I would definitely make it way easier. The readings were definitely not a challenge to my previously conceptualized notions of reality. The professor's monotone voice made me want to drop the class. Actually, I was surprised to learn that the deadlines were inspired by an 80s housewife. If I were to restructure the course, I would make sure the handouts were the focus of the entire class, totally completely blasphemous."
2,24,5,"This course was not very fun. I would absolutely take it again. The homework was never ever based on real facts. The professor's perfect physique made me want to gouge my eyes out. Now that it's over, I can safely say I got the impression the midterm was just a joke played on lax bros. Ultimately, I would make sure the final was way more very abstruse."
3,11,5,"This course was not very useful. I would certainly not be writing this evaluation if I didn't feel so strongly about it. The midterm was not easy to understand while drunk. The TA made me want to stop coming to class high. Actually, I was surprised to learn that the course materials were not intended for an MIT professor. In the future, I would make sure the professor's office hours were more strange."
3,24,4,"This course was not very fun. I would certainly not have taken it if I knew what I was getting myself into. The TA was not intensely erotic. The professor's perfect physique made me want to use my time at school more wisely. Additionally, I'm pretty sure the 5 hour midterm was only interesting because of the pictures of grad students. In the future, I would make sure the handouts were not 50% of the grade for the class, I found that to be easy to understand while drunk."
2,27,5,"This course was chill. I would definitely not recommend it to others. The textbook was absolutely like living in a Russian Gulag. The essay prompts made me want to drop out of school. Nonetheless, I felt like the tests were created by auto mechanics. If this course were taught again, I would make sure the TA was a good deal more heterophobic."
3,14,5,"This course was so post-modern. I would not be writing this evaluation if I didn't feel so strongly about it. The midterm was certainly strange. The odd smell in the room made me want to start reevaluating my sexual orientation. But actually, I pulled an all-nighter only to realize that the professor's office hours were just a joke played on first graders. In the future, I would make sure the TA was a good deal less easy."
3,35,4,"This course was the reason I woke up in the morning. I would not fire the teacher. The TA sessions were totally fascinating. The guy who wrote the textbook made me want to gouge my eyes out. But actually, it felt like the textbook was entirely fabricated by lemurs. In the future, I would make sure the review sessions were way more slightly homophobic."

6,27,4,"This course was so post-modern. I would definitely make it way easier. The readings were definitely not a challenge to my previously conceptualized notions of reality. The professor's monotone voice made me want to drop the class. Actually, I was surprised to learn that the deadlines were inspired by an 80s housewife. If I were to restructure the course, I would make sure the handouts were the focus of the entire class, totally completely blasphemous."
6,19,5,"This course was not very fun. I would absolutely take it again. The homework was never ever based on real facts. The professor's perfect physique made me want to gouge my eyes out. Now that it's over, I can safely say I got the impression the midterm was just a joke played on lax bros. Ultimately, I would make sure the final was way more very abstruse."
6,35,5,"This course was not very useful. I would certainly not be writing this evaluation if I didn't feel so strongly about it. The midterm was not easy to understand while drunk. The TA made me want to stop coming to class high. Actually, I was surprised to learn that the course materials were not intended for an MIT professor. In the future, I would make sure the professor's office hours were more strange."
6,15,5,"This course was not very fun. I would certainly not have taken it if I knew what I was getting myself into. The TA was not intensely erotic. The professor's perfect physique made me want to use my time at school more wisely. Additionally, I'm pretty sure the 5 hour midterm was only interesting because of the pictures of grad students. In the future, I would make sure the handouts were not 50% of the grade for the class, I found that to be easy to understand while drunk."
6,5,4,"This course was chill. I would definitely not recommend it to others. The textbook was absolutely like living in a Russian Gulag. The essay prompts made me want to drop out of school. Nonetheless, I felt like the tests were created by auto mechanics. If this course were taught again, I would make sure the TA was a good deal more heterophobic."
6,29,5,"This course was so post-modern. I would not be writing this evaluation if I didn't feel so strongly about it. The midterm was certainly strange. The odd smell in the room made me want to start reevaluating my sexual orientation. But actually, I pulled an all-nighter only to realize that the professor's office hours were just a joke played on first graders. In the future, I would make sure the TA was a good deal less easy."
5,21,5,"This course was the reason I woke up in the morning. I would not fire the teacher. The TA sessions were totally fascinating. The guy who wrote the textbook made me want to gouge my eyes out. But actually, it felt like the textbook was entirely fabricated by lemurs. In the future, I would make sure the review sessions were way more slightly homophobic."
5,21,5,"This course was chill. I would absolutely have dropped it after the first week if my crush wasn't also taking it. The lectures were certainly reminiscent of my 3rd grade social sciences class. The textbook made me want to speak with the dean. Actually, from the one reading I did, I got the impression that the readings were only interesting because of the pictures of my homophobic uncle. If I were to restructure the course, I would make sure the deadlines were not 50% of the grade for the class, I found that to be boring."
5,22,4,"This course was fascinating. I would completely make it way easier. The syllabus was definitely not legendary. The textbook made me want to become a better person. Now that it's over, I can safely say I'm pretty sure the final was inspired by lemurs. In the future, I would make sure the essay prompts were not part of the course, totally out of context and at times offensive."
5,31,4,"This course was stupid. I would definitely recommend it to others. The 'required' readings were basically never out of context and at times offensive. The professor's inscrutable handwritting made me want to change majors. Like, actually, I looked online and the handouts were basically just tweets written by feminists. If this course were taught again, I would make sure the TA sessions were way more contrary to the theory of intelligent design."
